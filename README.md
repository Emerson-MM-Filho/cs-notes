# Computer Science Notes 📚

> **Bridging the gap between technical depth and accessible learning**

## 🎯 Mission

This repository contains comprehensive computer science notes designed to be both technically rigorous and accessible to learners at all levels. Whether you're a CS student, a career changer, or simply curious about how computers work, these notes aim to make complex concepts understandable without sacrificing accuracy.

## 👥 Target Audience

- **CS Students**: Deepen your understanding with clear explanations and practical implementations
- **Self-taught Programmers**: Fill knowledge gaps with structured, academic-quality content
- **Curious Minds**: Learn fundamental CS concepts without needing a CS background
- **Educators**: Use as teaching material or reference for creating accessible technical content

## 🧠 Content Philosophy

### Technical Accuracy + Simple Language
Every concept is explained using:
- **Plain English first**: Complex ideas broken down into digestible parts
- **Real-world analogies**: Abstract concepts connected to familiar experiences  
- **Step-by-step progression**: Building from simple to complex
- **Multiple perspectives**: Intuitive understanding + formal definitions

### Example: Big O Notation
```
🤔 **What is it?**: A way to describe how an algorithm's performance changes as input size grows.

🏃 **Real-world analogy**: Like describing how long it takes to find a book:
- In a small pile (10 books): Quick to scan through
- In a library (10,000 books): Need a systematic approach

📊 **Mathematical notation**: O(n) means time grows linearly with input size n

🐍 **Python example**: See /algorithms/complexity/big_o_examples.py
```

Each topic folder contains:
- `README.md`: Topic overview and learning path
- `concepts/`: Theoretical explanations with LaTeX math
- `implementations/`: Python code examples and exercises
- `resources/`: Additional reading and references

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic mathematics (high school algebra)
- Curiosity and patience for learning complex topics
- No prior programming experience required (we'll teach you!)

### Tools You'll Need
- **Python 3.8+**: For running code examples
- **LaTeX viewer**: For mathematical notation (GitHub renders most LaTeX automatically)
- **Code editor**: VS Code, PyCharm, or any text editor

### Quick Start
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Navigate to a topic that interests you
3. Start with the topic's `README.md` for an overview
4. Read concept files for theory
5. Run Python examples to see concepts in action

## 💻 Code Standards

All Python implementations follow these principles:
- **Educational over efficient**: Code clarity prioritized over performance
- **Extensive comments**: Every non-trivial line explained
- **Type hints**: For better code understanding
- **Docstrings**: Clear function/class documentation
- **Testing**: Examples include test cases when helpful

### Example Code Style
```python
def binary_search(arr: list[int], target: int) -> int:
    """
    Find target in sorted array using binary search.
    
    Think of this like finding a word in a dictionary:
    - Open to middle page
    - Go left half if target comes before, right half if after
    - Repeat until found
    
    Time Complexity: O(log n) - much faster than checking every element!
    
    Args:
        arr: Sorted list of integers to search through
        target: The value we're looking for
    
    Returns:
        Index of target if found, -1 if not in array
    """
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        # Find middle point (avoiding overflow in other languages)
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Found it!
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Target is in right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Target is in left half
    
    return -1  # Not found
```

## 📐 Mathematical Notation

LaTeX is used for mathematical expressions:
- Inline math: `$O(n \log n)$` renders as $O(n \log n)$
- Block equations: 
```latex
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
```
