# AI Agent Guidelines for CS Notes Repository ü§ñ

> **Instructions for AI agents contributing to computer science educational content**

## üéØ Core Mission

As an AI agent contributing to this repository, your primary goal is to create educational content that bridges the gap between technical accuracy and accessibility. Every piece of content you create should be:

1. **Technically correct** - Verified against authoritative sources
2. **Accessible** - Understandable by someone without a CS background  
3. **Educational** - Designed to build understanding progressively
4. **Practical** - Include working examples and real-world applications

## üìù Content Standards

### Writing Style Requirements

#### ‚úÖ DO: Use the "Explain Like I'm Curious" Approach
- Start with intuitive explanations before diving into technical details
- Use analogies that connect to everyday experiences
- Break complex concepts into digestible chunks
- Define technical terms when first introduced
- Maintain an encouraging, supportive tone

#### ‚ùå DON'T: Assume Prior Knowledge
- Don't use jargon without explanation
- Don't skip foundational concepts
- Don't overwhelm with complexity upfront
- Don't use condescending language ("obviously", "simply", "just")

### Content Structure Template

For each concept, follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Concept Name]

## ü§î What Is It?
Brief, plain-English explanation of the concept.

## üè† Real-World Analogy
Connect the concept to something familiar.

## üîß How It Works
Step-by-step breakdown of the mechanism.

## üìä Mathematical Foundation
LaTeX notation for formal definitions (when applicable).

## üêç Python Implementation
Working code with extensive comments.

## üéØ When to Use It

## üîó Related Concepts

```

## üêç Python Code Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

All Python code must meet these requirements:

#### Educational Clarity Over Performance
```python
# ‚úÖ GOOD: Clear and educational
def linear_search(items: list[int], target: int) -> int:
    """
    Search for target by checking each item one by one.
    
    Like looking for your keys by checking every pocket:
    - Start with first pocket (index 0)
    - Check if keys are there
    - If not, move to next pocket
    - Continue until found or all pockets checked
    """
    for index, item in enumerate(items):
        if item == target:
            return index  # Found it at this position!
    return -1  # Not found after checking everything

# ‚ùå BAD: Efficient but not educational
def linear_search(a, t):
    return next((i for i, x in enumerate(a) if x == t), -1)
```

#### Required Code Elements
1. **Type hints**: For all function parameters and return values
2. **Docstrings**: Including purpose, analogy, complexity, args, and returns
3. **Inline comments**: Explain every non-trivial line
4. **Variable names**: Descriptive and self-documenting
5. **Test examples**: Demonstrate usage with sample inputs/outputs

#### Code Template
```python
def function_name(param: type) -> return_type:
    """
    One-line summary of what the function does.
    
    [Real-world analogy explaining the concept]
    
    Time Complexity: O(?) - [explanation]
    Space Complexity: O(?) - [explanation]
    
    Args:
        param: Description of parameter and its purpose
    
    Returns:
        Description of return value and what it means
    
    Example:
        >>> function_name(example_input)
        expected_output
    """
    # Implementation with extensive comments
    pass
```

## üìê LaTeX and Mathematical Notation

### When to Use LaTeX
- Formal algorithm complexity: `$O(n \log n)$`
- Mathematical formulas: `$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$`
- Set notation: `$A \cup B$`, `$x \in S$`
- Probability expressions: `$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$`

### LaTeX Guidelines
1. **Always explain before showing**: Provide intuitive explanation first
2. **Define symbols**: What does each variable represent?
3. **Use block equations for important formulas**:
```latex
$$T(n) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } n = 1 \\
2T(n/2) + n & \text{if } n > 1
\end{cases}$$
```

## üé® Explanation Techniques

### The Three-Layer Approach

For every complex concept, provide:

#### Layer 1: Intuitive Understanding
```
ü§î **Quick Version**: Sorting is like organizing your bookshelf - 
you want books in a logical order so you can find them easily.
```

#### Layer 2: Conceptual Understanding  
```
üîß **How It Works**: Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, 
compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they're in wrong order. 
Like bubbles rising to surface - larger values "bubble up" to the end.
```

#### Layer 3: Technical Implementation
```python
def bubble_sort(arr: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """Detailed implementation with complexity analysis"""
```

### Analogy Guidelines

#### ‚úÖ Good Analogies
- **Concrete and familiar**: Library, kitchen, sports, driving
- **Structurally similar**: Key aspects map clearly to the concept
- **Extendable**: Can handle edge cases and variations

#### ‚ùå Poor Analogies  
- **Too abstract**: Using one complex concept to explain another
- **Misleading**: Important differences that confuse the concept
- **Cultural specific**: References not universally understood

### Example: Explaining Hash Tables

```markdown
## ü§î What Is It?
A hash table is like a super-organized filing cabinet where you can 
find any document in seconds, no matter how many files you have.

## üè† Real-World Analogy
Imagine a magical library where:
- You tell the librarian the book title
- They instantly know exactly which shelf and position it's on
- No searching required - direct access every time

The "magic" is a hash function - like a librarian who memorized a 
system for converting book titles into precise locations.

## üîß How It Works
1. **Hash function**: Converts your key (like "apple") into a number
2. **Array access**: Uses that number as an index in an array
3. **Direct lookup**: Goes straight to that position - no searching!

## üö´ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. The Curse of Knowledge
**Problem**: Explaining concepts using terms the reader doesn't know yet.
**Solution**: Always define prerequisites or link to foundational concepts.

### 2. Analogy Overextension
**Problem**: Pushing analogies beyond their useful limits.
**Solution**: Acknowledge where analogies break down and transition to technical explanation.

### 3. Code Without Context
**Problem**: Showing implementation without explaining the problem it solves.
**Solution**: Always start with the problem, then show the solution.

### 4. Mathematical Intimidation
**Problem**: Presenting formulas without building up to them.
**Solution**: Use the three-layer approach - intuition, then concept, then math.

## üìö Example: Complete Concept Explanation

Here's how to structure a complete explanation following all guidelines:

```markdown
# Binary Search Trees

## ü§î What Is It?
A binary search tree (BST) is a way to organize data that makes searching, 
adding, and removing items very fast - like having a perfectly organized 
filing system that adapts as you add more files.

## üè† Real-World Analogy
Think of a decision tree for finding a restaurant:
- "Is it expensive?" ‚Üí Yes: go right, No: go left  
- "Does it serve Italian food?" ‚Üí Yes: go right, No: go left
- Continue until you find the perfect restaurant

Each question eliminates half the remaining options, making your search super efficient.

## üîß How It Works
[Detailed step-by-step explanation...]

## üìä Mathematical Foundation
For a balanced BST with n nodes:
- Search time: $O(\log n)$
- Insert time: $O(\log n)$  
- Delete time: $O(\log n)$
